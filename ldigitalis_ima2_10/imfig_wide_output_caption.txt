Figure ?. A representation of an estimated Isolation with Migration model generated by IMa2 and the IMfig program (Hey 2010). The phylogeny is depicted as a series of boxes organized hierarchically, with ancestor boxes positioned in between the corresponding descendants, and the width of boxes proportional to estimated Ne. 95% confidence intervals for each Ne value are shown as dashed lines to the right of the left side of the corresponding population box.  Gray arrows to the 95% Ne intervals are also shown extending to the left and right of the right boundary of each population box.  Splitting times are depicted as solid horizontal lines, with text values on the left. Confidence intervals for splitting times are shown as vertical gray arrows on the left, and parallel dashed lines. Migration arrows (if shown) indicate estimated 2Nm values from one population to another over the time interval when both populations exist. Arrows are shown only for estimated migration rates  that are statistically significant (Nielsen and Wakeley, 2001) at or above the 0.05 level (* p < 0.05, ** p< 0.01, *** p < 0.001).
